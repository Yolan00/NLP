NLP PROJECT
NLP COURSE (20124)
DONE BY: Simone Baratella


This repository contains the modified codes and processing table used for the third part of the NLP exam.
(Reference work: https://github.com/ml-for-nlp/build-your-search-engine)

I obviously recommend opening the table using excel to avoid strange artefacts.
As I am relatively new to the world of programming, the codes may contain formal inaccuracies or inefficiencies.
Chat-GPT was used to support me in editing the code.
