NLP PROJECT
NLP COURSE (20124)
DONE BY: Simone Baratella


This repository contains the modified codes and processing table used for the third part of the NLP exam.

I obviously recommend opening the table using excel to avoid strange artefacts.
As I am relatively new to the world of programming, the codes may contain formal inaccuracies or inefficiencies, even if not entirely written by me and only tweaked.
